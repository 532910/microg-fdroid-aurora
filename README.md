# microg fdroid aurora

This is a simple rework of [fdroid privileged-extension](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/privileged-extension)
that icludes [microG](https://github.com/microg) and [Aurora Services](https://gitlab.com/AuroraOSS/AuroraServices)
and supports installation on [crDroid](https://crdroid.net/) 9.

This is not a project that I'm gonna support, just sharing my experience.
